Getting started with the Web:
---------------------------

- An automation system, like Webpack, Grunt, or Gulp to automatically perform repetitive tasks, such as minifying code and running tests (is this needed?)
- Live server through Visual Studio goes through HTTP. Python & XAMPP can also be used to simulate remote requests / servers.
- SVG images can be drawn in HTML or with assisted software (inkskape, illustrator, sketch)

What will you website look like?
------------------------------

- What is your website about? Do you like dogs, New York, or Pac-Man?
- What information are you presenting on the subject? Write a title and a few paragraphs and think of an image you'd like to show on your page.
- What does your website look like, in simple high-level terms? What's the background color? What kind of font is appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle?
